# Pathly

Pathly is a light-weight Fabric Minecraft mod that makes
creating path blocks smoother and more intuitive.

Paths can be created by directly targeting e.g. dirt blocks or by
targeting "replaceable" blocks on top of them.

This makes path-making feel much more natural—no more needing to clear vegetation before using a shovel!

## ✨ Features

- Automatically shifts the shovel’s path-creation check one block downward when the aimed block is replaceable.
- Fully vanilla-friendly behavior—does not change the properties of any block.
- Works with any Shovel Item

## 🔧 Configuration

- Additional replaceable blocks can be specified with the newly added [pathly:path_top_replacables](src/main/generated/data/pathly/tags/blocks/path_top_replacables.json) block tag
- Using the `"enablePathTopReplacables"` Gamerule, the replaceable feature can be enabled and disabled
